## ‚ú® Key Features

-   **Natural Language Interaction**: Manage your calendar using plain English.
-   **Create Events**: "Book a meeting with the team tomorrow at 2 PM."
-   **List Events**: "What's on my schedule for this Friday?"
-   **Postpone Events**: "Reschedule my 10 AM meeting to 3 PM."
-   **Delete Events**: "Cancel the project sync."
-   **Smart Tool Selection**: Uses LangChain's LangGraph to intelligently decide which calendar tool to use based on your request.
-   **Web Interface**: Easy-to-use chat UI built with Streamlit.
-   **Containerized**: Fully containerized with Docker for easy deployment.

## üèõÔ∏è Architecture

The application uses a decoupled architecture where the Streamlit UI communicates with a FastAPI backend. The backend processes the user's request using a LangGraph agent, which leverages the Together AI LLM to understand intent and call the appropriate Google Calendar tools.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.11+
-   A Google Cloud project with the Google Calendar API enabled.
-   A Google Cloud Service Account with permissions to manage calendars.
-   A Together AI API Key.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/DikshitKumar-code/Calender-agent.git
cd Calender-agent
```

### 2. Set Up Environment

Create a virtual environment and install the required dependencies.

```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your credentials.

**`.env` file:**

```
TOGETHER_API_KEY="your_together_ai_api_key"
```

You also need your Google Cloud Service Account JSON key.
1.  Download the `service-account.json` file from your Google Cloud project.
2.  Place it in the root directory of the project.

### 4. Run Locally

This application requires two services to run concurrently: the FastAPI backend and the Streamlit frontend.

**Terminal 1: Start the FastAPI Backend**

```
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

**Terminal 2: Start the Streamlit UI**

```
streamlit run streamlit.py
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`.

## üê≥ Docker & Deployment on Render

This project is configured for easy deployment on Render using Docker.

### The Dockerfile

The `Dockerfile` creates a production-ready image that:
1.  Uses a slim Python 3.11 base image.
2.  Copies the application code.
3.  Installs dependencies from `requirements.txt`.
4.  Uses a single `CMD` to run both the Uvicorn server (for FastAPI) and the Streamlit app concurrently.

### Deploying to Render

1.  **Fork this repository** to your own GitHub account.
2.  Go to the [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com/) and click **New > Web Service**.
3.  Connect your GitHub account and select your forked repository.
4.  Configure the service:
    -   **Environment**: Select `Docker`.
    -   **Name**: Give your service a name (e.g., `calendar-agent`).
    -   **Region**: Choose a region close to you.
5.  Under the **Advanced** section:
    -   **Add Environment Variable**:
        -   **Key**: `TOGETHER_API_KEY`
        -   **Value**: Paste your Together AI API key.
    -   **Add Secret File**:
        -   **Filename**: `service-account.json`
        -   **Contents**: Paste the entire content of your `service-account.json` file.
        -   **NOTE**: The `utilities.py` file is configured to look for this secret file at `/etc/secrets/service-account.json`, which is where Render places it.
6.  Click **Create Web Service**. Render will automatically build the Docker image and deploy your application.

## üìù API Endpoints

The FastAPI backend exposes the following endpoints:

| Method | Endpoint  | Description                               |
| :----- | :-------- | :---------------------------------------- |
| `POST` | `/invoke` | Processes user input via the LangGraph agent. |
| `GET`  | `/health` | Health check to confirm the API is running. |

## üí° Usage Examples

Interact with the chat UI using natural language:

-   "Create an event for 'Team Lunch' this Friday from 1 PM to 2 PM."
-   "What do I have scheduled for tomorrow morning?"
-   "Postpone today's 5 pm meeting to tomorrow 10 am"
-   "Cancel my meeting about the project review."
